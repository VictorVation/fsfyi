Flying a plane is a dream for many people, but it takes more than just a passion for aviation to become a pilot. One of the first steps in becoming a pilot is obtaining a pilot's license. But with so many different types of pilot licenses available, it can be confusing to know where to start. In this article, we'll give you an introduction to the most common pilot licenses in the order they're obtained in.

## Student Pilot License (SPL)

The first license a prospective pilot needs is a Student Pilot License (SPL). This license allows the pilot to fly under the supervision of a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI). An SPL is the first step towards obtaining a Private Pilot License (PPL) and requires a minimum age of 16 and a medical certificate.

## Private Pilot License (PPL)

The Private Pilot License (PPL) is the most common pilot license and allows a pilot to fly for personal or recreational purposes. To obtain a PPL, a pilot must have completed a minimum of 40 hours of flight time, including 20 hours of flight with a CFI and 10 hours of solo flight time. In addition, the pilot must pass a written test and a flight test.

## Instrument Rating (IR)

The Instrument Rating (IR) allows a pilot to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and navigate solely by reference to instruments. This rating is necessary for pilots who want to fly for commercial purposes, such as charter flights. To obtain an IR, a pilot must have completed a minimum of 50 hours of cross-country flight time and pass a written test and a flight test.

## Commercial Pilot License (CPL)

The Commercial Pilot License (CPL) is required for pilots who want to fly for compensation or hire. To obtain a CPL, a pilot must have completed a minimum of 250 hours of flight time, including 100 hours of pilot-in-command time and 50 hours of cross-country flight time. In addition, the pilot must pass a written test and a flight test.

## Multi-Engine Rating (MER)

A Multi-Engine Rating allows a pilot to fly aircraft with more than one engine. This rating is necessary for pilots who want to fly larger aircraft, such as jets or commercial planes. It is often obtained after a pilot has already obtained their Commercial Pilot License.

To obtain an MER, a pilot must complete a ground school course and a minimum of 10 hours of flight training, including a minimum of 7 hours of flight time in a multi-engine aircraft. The pilot must also pass a written test and a flight test.

It's important to note that while an MER is not a pilot license, it is a valuable qualification to have for pilots who want to pursue a career in commercial aviation. Many flight schools offer multi-engine training programs, which can be completed in conjunction with a Commercial Pilot License or Airline Transport Pilot License program.

If you're interested in flying larger aircraft, consider obtaining an MER along with your pilot license. It's a valuable addition to your qualifications and can open up new opportunities in the aviation industry.

## Airline Transport Pilot License

The Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL) is the highest level of pilot license and is required for pilots who want to fly for airlines or other commercial aviation operations. To obtain an ATPL, a pilot must have completed a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time, including 500 hours of cross-country flight time. In addition, the pilot must pass a written test and a flight test.

## Conclusion

Obtaining a pilot's license is an exciting and challenging process. The first step is obtaining a Student Pilot License, followed by a Private Pilot License, Instrument Rating, Commercial Pilot License, and finally, an Airline Transport Pilot License. It's important to find a reputable flight school with experienced instructors to ensure a successful training experience. If you're interested in becoming a pilot, start your journey by researching flight schools and flight training programs near you. Happy flying!
